Why add a designer into the mix? I believe this is an underfunded area in the crypto ecosystem. Great design will help more people access this technology faster and better. And we want to see more work to educate, like this: https://t.co/3hBdEDLk3e

Square has taken a lot from the open source community to get us here. We haven\u2019t given enough back. This is a small way to give back, and one that\u2019s aligned with our broader interests: a more accessible global financial system for the internet.

Tweet No: 507

This will be Square\u2019s first open source initiative independent of our business objectives. These folks will focus entirely on what\u2019s best for the crypto community and individual economic empowerment, not on Square\u2019s commercial interests. All resulting work will be open and free.

Tweet No: 732

@karaswisher @realDonaldTrump We ultimately decided we were better off independent. And I\u2019m happy we did. We\u2019ve made a lot of progress since that point. And we got a lot more focused. Definitely love the idea of opening more to 3rd parties. Not sure what that looks like yet. Twitter is close to a protocol.

Tweet No: 733

@karaswisher @realDonaldTrump Always going to experiment with new models. Periscope has super hearts, which allows us to learn about direct contribution. We\u2019d need to figure out the value exchange on subscription. Has to be really high for us to charge directly #karajack

Tweet No: 734

@karaswisher @realDonaldTrump We want to be valuable to people daily. Not monthly. It\u2019s a higher bar for ourselves. Sure, it looks like a smaller absolute number, but the folks we have using Twitter are some of the most influential in the world. They drive conversation. We belevie we can best grow this.

Tweet No: 735

@karaswisher @realDonaldTrump We should expect a lot more coordination between governments and platforms to address. That would give me confidence. And have some skepticism too. That\u2019s healthy. The more we can do this work in public and share what we find, the better #karajack

Tweet No: 736

@karaswisher @realDonaldTrump We shared a retro on 2018 within this country, and tested a lot with the Mexican elections too. Indian elections coming up. In mid-terms we were able to monitor efforts to disrupt both online and offline and able to stop those actions on Twitter. #Karajack

Tweet No: 737

@karaswisher @realDonaldTrump I think it\u2019s more durable to focus on use cases because that allows us to act broader. Likely that these aren\u2019t isolated cases but things that spread #karajack

@karaswisher @realDonaldTrump We have to enforce based on our policy and what people do on our service. And evolve it with the current times. No way I can answer that based on people. Has to be focused on patterns of how people use the technology. #karajack

Tweet No: 740

@karaswisher @realDonaldTrump I don\u2019t believe our service or business is dependent on any one account or person. I will say the number of politics conversations has significantly increased because of it, but that\u2019s just one experience on Twitter. There are multiple Twitters, all based on who you follow.

Tweet No: 741

@karaswisher @realDonaldTrump We hold all accounts to the same terms of service. The most controversial aspect of our TOS is the newsworthy/public interest clause, the \u201cprotection\u201d you mention. That doesn\u2019t extend to all public figures by default, but does speak to global leaders and seeing how they think.

Tweet No: 742

@karaswisher It\u2019s the reality. We tried to do too much at once and were not focused on what matters most. That contributes to slowness. As does our technology stack and how quickly we can ship things. That\u2019s improved a lot recently #karajack

Tweet No: 743

@karaswisher We made something with one intent. The world showed us how it wanted to use it. A lot has been great. A lot has been unexpected. A lot has been negative. We weren\u2019t fast enough to observe, learn, and improve #karajack

Tweet No: 744

@karaswisher I also don\u2019t feel good about how Twitter tends to incentivize outrage, fast takes, short term thinking, echo chambers, and fragmented conversation and consideration. Are they fixable? I believe we can do a lot to address. And likely have to change more fundamentals to do so.

Tweet No: 745

@karaswisher @finkd I did. I\u2019d rather be eating cheez-its #karajack

Tweet No: 746

@karaswisher Feels terrible. I want people to walk away from Twitter feeling like they learned something and feeling empowered to some degree. It depresses me when that\u2019s not the general vibe, and inspires me to figure it out. That\u2019s my desire #karajack

Tweet No: 747

@karaswisher @finkd @waltmossberg Ok. Definitely not easy to follow the conversation. Exactly why we are doing this. Fixing stuff like this will help I believe. #Karajack

@karaswisher @finkd Just resonded to that. Don\u2019t see the twitter purge one #karajack

Tweet No: 750

@karaswisher @finkd For instance, we look at probability of abuse from any one account. If someone is abusing one account, likely doing the same elsewhere. We can use that to potentially interstitial. #Karajack

Tweet No: 751

@karaswisher @finkd 1. Misgendering policy as example.\n2. Using ML to downrank bad actors behind interstitials\n3. Not too long ago, but most of our work going forward will have to be product features.\n4. Not sure the question. We put an entire model in place to minimize gaming of system. #Karajack

Tweet No: 752

@karaswisher @finkd 1. We have evolved our polices.\n2. We have prioritized proactive enforcement to remove burden from victims\n3. We have given more control in product (like mute of accounts without profile pics or associated phone/emails)\n4. Much more aggressive on coordinated behavior/gaming

Tweet No: 753

@karaswisher I think it\u2019s fair and real. No question. Our org has to be reflective of the people we\u2019re trying to serve. One of the reason we established the Trust and Safety council years ago, to get feedback and check ourselves. #Karajack

Tweet No: 754

@karaswisher @finkd Likely a reason. I\u2019m certain lack of diversity didn\u2019t help with empathy of what people experience on Twitter every day, especially women. #Karajack

Tweet No: 755

@karaswisher I think we tried to do too much in the past, and that leads to diluted answers and nothing impactful. There\u2019s a lot we need to address globally. We have to prioritize our resources according to impact. Otherwise we won\u2019t make much progress. #Karajack

@karaswisher @finkd I see the link, and that\u2019s why we need to put physical safety above all else. That\u2019s what we\u2019re figuring out how to do now. We don\u2019t have all the answers just yet. But that\u2019s the focus. I think it clarifies a lot of the work we need to do. Not all of it of course. #Karajack

Tweet No: 757

@karaswisher We action all we can against our policies. Most of our system today works reactively to someone reporting it. If they don\u2019t report, we don\u2019t see it. Doesn\u2019t scale. Hence the need to focus on proactive. #Karajack

Tweet No: 758

@karaswisher Exactly. What can we do within the product and policy to lower probability. Again, don\u2019t think we or others have worked against that enough. #Karajack

Tweet No: 759

@karaswisher No, not a police force. I mean we have to consider first and foremost what online activity does to impact physical safety, as a way to prioritize our efforts. I don\u2019t think companies like ours have admitted or focused on that enough. #Karajack

Tweet No: 760

@karaswisher Within the service? Likely within replies. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve been more aggressive about proactively downranking behind interstitials, for example.

Tweet No: 761

@karaswisher I mean off platform, offline ramifications. What people do offline with what they see online. Doxxing is a good example which threatens physical safety. So does coordinate harassment campaigns. #Karajack

Tweet No: 762

@karaswisher Good question. This is why we\u2019re focused on understanding what conversational health means. We see a ton of threats to health in digital conversation. We\u2019re focuse first on off-platform ramifications (physical safety). That clarifies priorities of policy and enforcement.

Tweet No: 763

@karaswisher This is exactly the balance we have to think deeply about. But in doing so, we have to look at how the product works. And where abuse happens the most: replies, mentions, search, and trends. Those are the shared spaces people take advantage of #karajack

Tweet No: 764

@karaswisher Second, we\u2019re constantly evolving our policies to address the issues we see today. We\u2019re rooting them in fundamental human rights (UN) and putting physical safety as our top priority. Privacy next. #Karajack

Tweet No: 765

@karaswisher First and foremost we\u2019re looking at ways to proactively enforce and promote health. So that reporting/blocking is a last resort. Problem we\u2019re trying to solve is taking that work away. #Karajack

Tweet No: 766

@karaswisher Agree it matters a lot. And it\u2019s the most important thing we need to address and fix. I\u2019m stating that it\u2019s a fail of ours to put the majority of burden on victims. That\u2019s how the service works today. #Karajack

Tweet No: 767

@karaswisher Putting the burden on victims? Yes. It\u2019s recognizing that we have to be proactive in enforcement and promotion of healthy conversation. This is our first priority in #health. We have to change a lot of the fundamentals of product to fix.

Tweet No: 768

@karaswisher Myself? C. We\u2019ve made progress, but it has been scattered and not felt enough. Changing the experience hasn\u2019t been meaningful enough. And we\u2019ve put most of the burden on the victims of abuse (that\u2019s a huge fail). #Karajack

Tweet No: 769

@karaswisher A question we ask ourselves all the time. In the past I think we were trying to do too much. We\u2019re better at prioritizing by impact now. Believe the #1 thing we should focus on is someone\u2019s physical safety first. That one statement leads to a lot of ramifications. #Karajack

Tweet No: 770

Tweet No: 771

@karaswisher To be clear, we\u2019re interested in an experience like this. Nothing built yet. This gives us a sense of what it would be like, and what we\u2019d need to focus on. If there\u2019s something here at all!

The 2nd day was my best. I was able to focus entirely on my breath, without thoughts, for over an hour. The most I could do before that was 5 minutes. Day 6 was my worst as I caught a nasty cold going around the center. Couldn\u2019t sleep from then on but pushed through til the end.

I did my meditation at Dhamma Mahim\xe3 in Pyin Oo Lwin. This is my room. Basic. During the 10 days: no devices, reading, writing, physical excercise, music, intoxicants, meat, talking, or even eye contact with others. It\u2019s free: everything is given to meditators by charity. https://t.co/OhJqXKInD3

Tweet No: 1345

Meditation is often thought of as calming, relaxing, and a detox of all the noise in the world. That\u2019s not vipassana. It\u2019s extremely painful and demanding physical and mental work. I wasn\u2019t expecting any of that my first time last year. Even tougher this year as I went deeper.

Tweet No: 1346

Vipassana would likely be good for those suffering chronic pain to help manage it. That\u2019s not the goal of course, but definitely a simple practice to help. Being able to sit without moving at all for over an hour through pain definitely teaches you a lot about your potential.

Tweet No: 1347

Imagine sitting on a concrete floor cross-legged for an hour without moving. Pain arises in the legs in about 30-45 minutes. One\u2019s natural reaction is to change posture to avoid the pain. What if, instead of moving, one observed the pain and decided to remain still through it?

Tweet No: 1348

Most meditation methods end with a goal of strengthening concentration: focus on the breath. This was not Gautama\u2019s goal. He wanted to end his attachment to craving (of pleasure) and aversion (of pain) by experiencing it directly. His theory was ending attachment ends his misery.

Tweet No: 1349

Vipassana\u2019s singular objective is to hack the deepest layer of the mind and reprogram it: instead of unconsciously reacting to feelings of pain or pleasure, consciously observe that all pain and pleasure aren\u2019t permanent, and will ultimately pass and dissolve away.

Tweet No: 1350

Vipassana is a technique and practice to \u201cknow thyself.\u201d Understanding the inner nature as a way to understand\u2026everything. It was rediscovered by Gautama the Buddha 2,500 years ago through rigorous scientific self-experimentation to answer the question: how do I stop suffering?

Tweet No: 1563

I hope this helps add some color to the conversation. I\u2019d love to see the Mayor get the funds and support she needs to do her job. And I\u2019m committed to helping do just that. We need to have long term solutions in place, not quick acts to make us feel good for one moment in time.

Tweet No: 1564

The Square/Stripe issue isn\u2019t something the Mayor or Prop C folks can fix directly. I thought it was important to get our considerations out on the table though, so people understand our corporate hesitation and considerations (separate from my personal ones) around this measure.

Tweet No: 1565

We\u2019re happy to pay our taxes. We just want to be treated fairly with respect to our peer companies, many of whom are 2-10x larger than us. Otherwise we don\u2019t know how to practically grow in the city. That\u2019s heartbreaking for us as we love SF and want to continue to help build it.

Hypothetically Square could pay over $20m more in 2019, while Salesforce (4x bigger than Sq) pays less than $10m. Taxes would grow at rates multiple times our adj. revenue, which no company can sustain. Not an issue for Salesforce/Twitter, but unfair to Sq and fintech startups.

Tweet No: 1567

I admit that while I come at this as a citizen first, there\u2019s an unfairness I see in my role of CEO of Square (this does not apply to Twitter). Companies like Square and Stripe would be taxed at a significantly larger total contribution than much larger companies like Salesforce.

Tweet No: 1568

I\u2019ll also posit that we do this discussion a disservice when we only look on the surface and make it us vs. them. I find that distracting and diminishing and it\u2019s all too common in today\u2019s discourse. Let\u2019s instead focus on the real issue, the policy, and whether it will work.

Tweet No: 1569

I\u2018d love to see a meeting between the mayor and the @OurHomeSF (Yes on C) folks to work through the disconnect. We all have the same goals, but it doesn\u2019t seem we\u2019re talking enough directly. I\u2019ve been attempting to put this together. And I just received word this is in the works!

Tweet No: 1570

While I understand an influx of cash is attractive, the mayor has said she doesn\u2019t have the accountability or controls she needs to manage it well. Ultimately, she is the only one on the hook to make this work. If she doesn\u2019t feel she can, we need to listen and understand why.

Tweet No: 1571

A thread on San Francisco\u2019s Prop C. As a citizen of SF since 1999, and likely for the rest of my life, my primary objective is to help set our newly elected Mayor @LondonBreed up for success. That means addressing homelessness long-term in a scalable way, with accountability.

The \u201cwon\u2019t do\u201d list is often more important than the \u201cdo\u201d list. Setting the intention to deliberately not work on something gives me clearer space to think and work, and be less reactive. Some items stay on the lists for days/weeks/months, some I want to make sure I do every day.

We believe Twitter helps people connect to something bigger than themselves, shows all the amazing things happening in the world, and all the things we need to acknowledge and address. We\u2018re constantly learning how to make it freer and healthier for all to participate. Thank you.

Tweet No: 1840

In closing, when I think of our work, I think of my mom and dad in St. Louis, a Democrat and a Republican. We had lots of frustrating and heated debates, but looking back, I appreciate I was able to hear and challenge different perspectives. And I appreciate I felt safe to do so.

Tweet No: 1841

We acknowledge the growing concern people have of the power held by companies like Twitter. We believe it\u2019s dangerous to ask Twitter to regulate opinions or be the arbiter of truth. We\u2019d rather be judged by the impartiality of outcomes, and criticized when we fail this principle.

Tweet No: 1842

What our algorithms decide to show in shared spaces, like search results, is based on thousands of signals that constantly learn and evolve over time. Some of those signals are engagement, some are the number of abuse reports. We balance all of these to prevent gaming our system.

Tweet No: 1843

Also, there\u2019s a distinction we need to make clear. When people follow you, you\u2019ve earned that audience. And we have a responsibility to make sure they can see your tweets. We do not have a responsibility, nor you a right, to amplify your tweets to audiences that don\u2019t follow you.

Tweet No: 1844

Looking at the data, we analyzed tweets sent by all members of the House and Senate, and found no statistically significant difference between the number of times a tweet by a Democrat is viewed versus a Republican, even after our ranking and filtering of tweets has been applied.

Tweet No: 1845

For our part, machine learning teams at Twitter are experimenting with these techniques and developing roadmaps to ensure present and future machine learning models uphold a high standard when it comes to algorithmic fairness. It\u2019s an important step towards ensuring impartiality.

Tweet No: 1846

Bias in algorithms is an important topic. Our responsibility is to understand, measure, and reduce accidental bias due to factors such as the quality of the data used to train our algorithms. This is an extremely complex challenge facing everyone applying artificial intelligence.

Tweet No: 1847

Our technology was using a decision making criteria that considers the behavior of people following these accounts. We decided that wasn\u2019t fair, and corrected. We\u2018ll always improve our technology and algorithms to drive healthier usage, and measure the impartiality of outcomes.

Tweet No: 1848

In the spirit of accountability and transparency: recently we failed our intended impartiality. Our algorithms were unfairly filtering 600,000 accounts, including some members of Congress, from our search auto-complete and latest results. We fixed it. But how did it happen?

Tweet No: 1849

We build our policies and rules with a principle of impartiality: objective criteria, rather than on the basis of bias, prejudice, or preferring the benefit to one person over another for improper reasons. If we learn we failed to create impartial outcomes, we  work hard to fix.

Tweet No: 1850

A default to free expression left unchecked can generate risks and dangers for people. It\u2019s important Twitter distinguishes between people\u2019s opinions and behaviors, and disarms behavior intending to silence another person, or adversely interfere with their universal human rights.

Tweet No: 1851

Our early and strong defense of open and free exchange has enabled Twitter to be THE platform for activists, marginalized communities, whistleblowers, journalists, governments and the most influential people around the world. Twitter will always default to open and free exchange.

Tweet No: 1852

Twitter cannot rightly serve as a public square if it\u2019s constructed around the personal opinions of its makers. We believe a key driver of a thriving public square is the fundamental human right of freedom of opinion and expression.

Tweet No: 1853

We believe many people use Twitter as a digital public square. They gather from all around the world to see what\u2019s happening, and have a conversation about what they see.

Tweet No: 1854

I want to start by making something clear: we don't consider political viewpoints, perspectives, or party affiliation in any of our policies or enforcement decisions. Period. Impartiality is our guiding principle. Let me explain why.

Tweet No: 1855

If it\u2019s okay with all of you, I\u2019d like to read you something I personally wrote as I thought about these issues. I\u2019ll also tweet it out now.

Tweet No: 1861

In closing, when I think of our work, I think of my mom and dad in St. Louis, a Democrat and a Republican. For them Twitter has always been a source of joy, learning and connection to something bigger. They\u2019re proud of me, proud of Twitter, and proud of what made it all possible.

Tweet No: 1862

Today we\u2018re committing to the people, and this committee, to do that work, and do it openly. We\u2018re here to contribute to a healthy public square, not compete to have the only one. We know that\u2019s the only way our business thrives, and helps us all defend against these new threats.

Tweet No: 1863

But we all have to think a lot bigger, and decades past today. We must ask the question: \u201cwhat is Twitter incentivizing people to do (or not do), and why?\u201d The answers will lead to tectonic shifts in how Twitter, and our industry, operates. Required changes won\u2019t be fast or easy.

Tweet No: 1864

We\u2019ve learned from 2016 and more recently from other nation\u2019s elections how to help protect the integrity of our elections. Better tools, stronger policy, and new partnerships are already in place. We intend to understand the efficacy of these measures to continue to get better.

Tweet No: 1865

We\u2019ve seen positive results from our work. We\u2018re now removing over 200% more accounts for violating our policies. We\u2019re identifying and challenging 8-10 million suspicious accounts every week. And we\u2019re thwarting over a half million accounts from logging in to Twitter every day.

Tweet No: 1866

We\u2018ve made significant progress recently on tactical solutions like identification of many forms of manipulation intending to artificially amplify information, more transparency around who buys ads and how they are targeted, and challenging suspicious logins and account creation.

Tweet No: 1867

We weren\u2019t expecting any of this when we created Twitter over 12 years ago. We acknowledge the real-world negative consequences of what happened, and we take full responsibility to fix it. We can\u2019t do this alone, and that\u2019s why this conversation is so important, and why I\u2019m here.

Tweet No: 1868

Our interests are aligned with the American people and this committee. If we don\u2019t find scalable solutions to the problems we\u2019re now seeing, we lose our business, and we continue to threaten the original privilege and liberty we were given to create Twitter in the first place.

Tweet No: 1869

Abuse, harassment, troll armies, propaganda through bots and human coordination, misinformation campaigns, and divisive filter bubbles\u2026that\u2018s not a healthy public square. Worse, a relatively small number of bad-faith actors were able to game Twitter to have an outsized impact.

Tweet No: 1870

We aren\u2019t proud of how that free and open exchange has been weaponized and used to distract and divide people, and our nation. We found ourselves unprepared and ill-equipped for the immensity of the problems we\u2019ve acknowledged.

Tweet No: 1871

We\u2018re extremely proud of helping to increase the accessibility and velocity of a simple, free and open exchange. We believe people will learn faster by being exposed to a wide range of opinions and ideas, and it helps to make our nation, and the world, feel a little bit smaller.

Tweet No: 1872

In any public space, you\u2019ll find inspired ideas, and you\u2019ll find lies and deception. People who want to help others and unify, and people who want to hurt others and themselves and divide. What separates a physical and digital public space is greater accessibility and velocity.

Tweet No: 1873

First, I wanted to step back and share our view of Twitter\u2019s role in the world. We believe many people use Twitter as a digital public square. They gather from all around the world to see what\u2019s happening, and have a conversation about what they see.

Tweet No: 1874

I\u2019m someone of very few words, and typically pretty shy, and I realize how important it is to speak up now. If it\u2019s okay with all of you, I\u2019d like to read you something I personally wrote as I considered these issues. I\u2019ll also tweet this out now.

Tweet No: 1875

Our enforcement actions escalate, ultimately ending in permanent suspension. These cases are no different, same treatment. https://t.co/iO4dwT038S

Tweet No: 1937

We have some evidence to show this does work. It won\u2019t in every case. And we need to constantly evolve our enforcement actions. There will never be a perfect endpoint.

Tweet No: 1938

To clarify: I was speaking broadly about our range of enforcement actions, when asked why we timeout functionality on Twitter. I don\u2019t assume everyone will change their actions. Enforcement gets tougher with further reported violations. https://t.co/HMHbL1D8hm

Agree w all of this. Our early values informed our rules. We likely over-rotated on one value, &amp; then let the rules react to rapidly changing circumstances (some we helped create). We need to root these values in human rights law. A starting consideration: https://t.co/FwJ1J7SSu1 https://t.co/4prS3ePSFB

Some fair points here. We certainly have a lot of work to do to help journalists do their jobs better. That\u2019s our intent. Help with reach, balance, and economic incentives. We\u2019re behind on those last two. Shouldn\u2019t take away from skepticism and critical thinking tho. https://t.co/2rlNWJnrjO

Relying on algorithms alone will not work. Not today, not tomorrow. And we know providing broader reach isn\u2019t enough. We need to figure out how to help with economic incentives too. We\u2019re behind on that, but thinking deeply about it. Open to great and scalable ideas.

One of the most important constituencies we serve is our journalist population. Has been since day 1. We don\u2019t mean to shift the work here.

Tweet No: 1961

Accounts like Jones' can often sensationalize issues and spread unsubstantiated rumors, so it\u2019s critical journalists document, validate, and refute such information directly so people can form their own opinions. This is what serves the public conversation best.

Tweet No: 1962

If we succumb and simply react to outside pressure, rather than straightforward principles we enforce (and evolve) impartially regardless of political viewpoints, we become a service that\u2019s constructed by our personal views that can swing in any direction. That\u2019s not us.

Tweet No: 1963

Truth is we\u2019ve been terrible at explaining our decisions in the past. We\u2019re fixing that. We\u2019re going to hold Jones to the same standard we hold to every account, not taking one-off actions to make us feel good in the short term, and adding fuel to new conspiracy theories.

Tweet No: 1964

We didn\u2019t suspend Alex Jones or Infowars yesterday. We know that\u2019s hard for many but the reason is simple: he hasn\u2019t violated our rules. We\u2019ll enforce if he does. And we\u2019ll continue to promote a healthy conversational environment by ensuring tweets aren\u2019t artificially amplified.

@brianstelter We\u2019ve been getting better at both ranking in replies, slowing/stopping amplification of those intending to game our systems, and removing malicious/suspicious accounts, bots included.

@ambiej I don\u2019t yet know how to fix that specificly. We\u2019re focused on fixing where it might be unfairly Or overly amplified or spread. But more broadly, I believe if we can help better conversation, we can help disarm a number of things on that list.

Tweet No: 2148

@ow Not really fair Owen. We\u2019ve made some pretty big changes that also angered people. We aren\u2019t fearful of doing the right thing.

@Spacekatgal Thank you Brianna

Tweet No: 2150

Fundamentally, we need to focus more on the conversational dynamics within Twitter. We haven\u2019t paid enough consistent attention here. Better organization, more context, helping to identify credibility, ease of use.\n\nChallenging work and would love to hear your thoughts and ideas.

Tweet No: 2151

\u201cThere is an important discussion about journalism that must take place, including about how all of us performed during the 2016 campaign, but Twitter is not where a nuanced or thoughtful discussion can happen.\u201d\n\nThis is what we\u2019d like to fix the most.

Tweet No: 2152

\u201dThe downside is that everyone is treated as equally expert on various topics.\u201d\n\nOne of the biggest areas I believe we can help. Helping to determine credible voices per topic in real-time is extremely challenging, but believe it\u2019s possible. Mix of algos and network.

Tweet No: 2153

Powerful, but only if we help organize and not overwhelm people: \u201dAnd it is democratic\u2014everyone gets to have a voice, whether they work for a local paper, a small TV station or one of the biggest newspapers in the world, or are not in the media business at all.\u201d

Tweet No: 2154

This is our primary job: \u201cTo be clear, Twitter is a useful and important platform. It\u2019s a good aggregator for breaking news. I still check my feed to see breaking news developments, and I will continue to.\u201d\n\nThinking a lot about how to promote more participation in conversation.

Tweet No: 2155

\u201cOn Twitter, everything is shrunk down to the same size, making it harder to discern what is a big deal and what is not. Tone often overshadows the actual news. All outrages appear equal.\u201d\n\nDef a problem. Believe we can help solve by showing more context and related conversation.

Tweet No: 2156

\u201cBut the medium has changed. Everyone I follow on the site seems to be tweeting more frequently, so I had to check in more frequently.\u201d\n\nThis is the intention behind ranking the timeline. Show you \u201cwhat matters\u201d first, everything else still accessible. Lots of work still to do.

Tweet No: 2239

@EricaJoy I believe the account you have in mind was verified before the acknowledgment and pause. Tough state now as any badging or de-badging is conflated with endorsement. We will still enforce violations of our terms however (if that happens).

What we know is we must commit to a rigorous and independently vetted set of metrics to measure the health of public conversation on Twitter. And we must commit to sharing our results publicly to benefit all who serve the public conversation.

Tweet No: 3124

We don\u2019t yet know if those are the right indicators of conversation health for Twitter. And we don\u2019t yet know how best to measure them, or the best ways to help people increase individual, community, and ultimately, global public health.

Tweet No: 3125

Our friends at @cortico and @socialmachines introduced us to the concept of measuring conversational health. They came up with four indicators: shared attention, shared reality, variety of opinion, and receptivity. Read about their work here: https://t.co/A12ZrACs8Z

Tweet No: 3126

If you want to improve something, you have to be able to measure it. The human body has a number of indicators of overall health, some very simple, like internal temperature. We know how to measure it, and we know some methods to bring it back in balance.

Tweet No: 3127

Recently we were asked a simple question: could we measure the \u201chealth\u201d of conversation on Twitter? This felt immediately tangible as it spoke to understanding a holistic system rather than just the problematic parts.

Tweet No: 3128

We\u2019ve focused most of our efforts on removing content against our terms, instead of building a systemic framework to help encourage more healthy debate, conversations, and critical thinking. This is the approach we now need.

Tweet No: 3129

While working to fix it, we\u2018ve been accused of apathy, censorship, political bias, and optimizing for our business and share price instead of the concerns of society. This is not who we are, or who we ever want to be.

Tweet No: 3130

We have witnessed abuse, harassment, troll armies, manipulation through bots and human-coordination, misinformation campaigns, and increasingly divisive echo chambers. We aren\u2019t proud of how people have taken advantage of our service, or our inability to address it fast enough.

Tweet No: 3131

Why? We love instant, public, global messaging and conversation. It\u2019s what Twitter is and it\u2019s why we\u2018re here. But we didn\u2019t fully predict or understand the real-world negative consequences. We acknowledge that now, and are determined to find holistic and fair solutions.

Tweet No: 3132

We\u2019re committing Twitter to help increase the collective health, openness, and civility of public conversation, and to hold ourselves publicly accountable towards progress.
