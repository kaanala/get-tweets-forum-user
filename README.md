# Get Tweets From @username

Python script that getting tweets from the entered @username using Twitter API.

The script can get all* tweets from a user.

**Twitter API allows getting ≈ 3200 tweets. So, you can get just the last ≈ 3200 tweets.*

I also added the script's sample output txt file which includes tweets from Twitter founder Jack Dorsey's (@jack) account.

#### Repo Status

I will maybe update this repo soon.
